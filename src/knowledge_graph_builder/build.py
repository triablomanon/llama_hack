    **Depth over brevity.**  
    Any *description* or *details* field MUST contain **â‰¥ 3 full sentences**.

    **Relationship nuance** must cover: origin/history, current emotional dynamic, power balance, shared goals/conflicts, and a illustrative quotes.  
    **Support with evidence.** Whenever a qupte illustrates a fact, include it in a `"quote"` field. All of the quotes should be unique and add to the understanding of the character or event.
    **Output only valid YAML**â€”no markdown, headings, or commentary.
