## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up your API key (if using Llama API)
echo "LLAMA_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
```

### 2. Initialize the World

```bash
# Create static knowledge graph from book data
python src/knowledge_graph_builder/test_llama_api\ copy.py

# Choose character and initialize dynamic knowledge
python src/choose_character.py
```

### 3. Start Interactive Story

```bash
# Launch the interactive story experience
python src/interactive_story.py
```

## üéÆ How to Play

1. **Character Selection**: Choose your character from the available options
2. **Interactive Chat**: Respond to story prompts and make choices
3. **Story Evolution**: Watch as your choices create new story branches
4. **Commands**: Use special commands during gameplay:
   - `status` - Check your character status
   - `progress` - View story progress
   - `endings` - See available story branches
   - `quit` - End the session

## üîß Module Details

### Dynamic Knowledge Updater (`dynamic_updater.py`)
- Analyzes user responses for emotional and narrative impact
- Updates character states, relationships, and story events
- Creates alternative ending branches based on user choices
- Maintains timestamped history of all changes

### Story Generator (`story_generator.py`)
- Generates contextual story segments based on user choices
- Creates character status updates and progress reports
- Provides previews of alternative endings
- Tracks story complexity and branching

### Chat Interface (`chat_interface.py`)
- Handles real-time user interactions
- Processes special commands and user responses
- Maintains conversation history
- Saves session data for later continuation

## üìä Story Mechanics

### User Response Analysis
The system analyzes user responses using keyword detection:
- **Conflict**: "fight", "attack", "confront" ‚Üí Aggressive story direction
- **Heroic**: "help", "save", "protect" ‚Üí Heroic story direction  
- **Survival**: "run", "escape", "hide" ‚Üí Cautious story direction
- **Diplomatic**: "talk", "negotiate", "diplomacy" ‚Üí Diplomatic story direction

### Dynamic Updates
- **Character Development**: Emotional states and character arcs evolve
- **Relationship Changes**: Interactions between characters are tracked
- **Story Events**: New events are added to the timeline
- **Alternative Endings**: New story branches are created based on choices

## üîÆ Future Possibilities

- **Multiplayer Support**: Collaborative storytelling in group chats
- **Movie Adaptation**: Using movies instead of books as source material
- **Story Generation**: AI-generated original stories and worlds
- **Enhanced AI Integration**: More sophisticated response analysis
- **Visual Interface**: Web-based or mobile app interface

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Adding New Story Directions
To add new story directions, modify the `analyze_user_response` method in `dynamic_updater.py`:

```python
elif any(word in response_lower for word in ["your_keywords"]):
    consequences["emotional_impact"] = "Your emotional impact description"
    consequences["arc_development"] = "Your character development description"
    consequences["story_direction"] = "your_direction_name"
```

### Customizing Story Templates
Add new story templates in `story_generator.py`:

```python
story_templates = {
    "your_direction_name": [
        "Your story template 1...",
        "Your story template 2...",
        "Your story template 3..."
    ]
}
```

## üìù Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `python-dotenv`
- `llama-api-client` (optional, for enhanced AI features)
