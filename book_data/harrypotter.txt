Star Wars: Shadow of the Jedi

Setting:
After the fall of the Empire, its remnants scattered across the galaxy. But the dark side of the Force still lingered. Luke Skywalker traveled from system to system, working to rebuild the Jedi Order.

Characters:
- Kaine Narios – A young starship mechanic from a remote Outer Rim planet who unknowingly possesses a strong connection to the Force.
- Master Luke Skywalker – The last known Jedi Master, seeking to rebuild the Jedi Order.
- Enoch Vale – A former Imperial intelligence officer who now leads a secret dark side cult known as The Blades of Kallak.

Plot:
On the dusty, industrial planet of Braxa, Kaine Narios works as a mechanic in a backwater starport. Lately, he's been haunted by strange dreams—visions of battles, fire, and a glowing blue lightsaber in his hand. Deep inside, he senses he's not meant for a quiet life. But he also fears the unknown power stirring within him.

Far away, Luke Skywalker senses a new ripple in the Force—raw, unstable, and powerful. He journeys to Braxa and meets Kaine, quickly realizing the young man’s potential. But Luke also senses another presence: dark and familiar.

Enoch Vale, once an Imperial officer, has been gathering Force-sensitive individuals and twisting them toward the dark side. He sees Kaine as the perfect weapon to shape in his image.

A choice looms: Will Kaine walk the path of the Jedi—or fall to the shadows?
